# Project Overview

This project focuses on processing the UCI HAR Dataset to create tidy data for later analysis. 
The steps include merging data files, extracting relevant features, and summarizing the data.

# File Structure
    - **run_analysis.R**: R script that performs data processing steps.
    - **CodeBook.md**: Describes variables, data, and transformations.
    - **HAR_tidy_dataset.txt**: Tidy dataset in long format.

# Instructions for Reproducing the Analysis
    1. Install R (if not already installed).
    2. Clone this repository: https://github.com/jnk174/run_analysis
    3. Set the working directory to the UCI HAR Dataset folder.
    4. Run **run_analysis.R** to generate the tidy datasets.
    5. Refer to **CodeBook.md** for variable details.
